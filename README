Thank you for using MSOEngine.

This (when it's done) will provide a full Objective-C implementation of the Stack Overflow API.

As of right now, here's how to use it:

    #import "MSOEngine.h"
      MSOEngine *msoengine = [[MSOEngine alloc] init];
     [msoengine setURL:@"url"];
     [msoengine setAPIKey:@"key"];
     NSArray *badges =[msoengine getBadgesforKey:@"name" hasCustomURL:@"url"]; 
     NSString *users = [msoengine getUserID:167586 forKey:@"up_vote_count"];
     NSArray *questions =[msoengine getQuestions:@"title"]; 
     NSString *stats = [msoengine getStats:@"badges_per_minute"];

For all Keys please refer to the topics posted at dev.meta.stackoverflow.com
